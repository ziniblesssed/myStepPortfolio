        <p>
            Welcome!! Hope you've been staying safe. 
            Hopefully we see each other when the world is at peace again. 
            My name is Adedeji Adebisi, I am currently studying Mathematics 
            and Computer Science at Mississippi Valley State University.
            I love playing soccer and I play FIFA when I can‚Äôt go outside to play. 
            My computer science journey is quite different because when I left Nigeria,
            I was a Mathematics major and I never thought I‚Äôd have anything to do with 
            programming. After my first class in programming 1, I fell in love with 
            programming. I love challenges and the thought of solving a problem is what 
            drove me more towards computer science. I care a lot about data privatization
            and I had been on 2 research teams on these topic. Hopefully our research
            paper gets published someday.  My favorite programming language is C++. 
            I lived in Nigeria till I was 19, and I am well used to being an African
            before anything else. check out the remaining of this page,
            i will be featuring my best footballer, Cristiano Ronaldo.

        <p>Arguably, I think Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the World of Football.
            After the 2004 tsunami, having spotted a survivor wearing a Portugal shirt with his number
            7 on it, Ronaldo raised funds for the reconstruction of Aceh in Indonesia.
            Ronaldo remained in contact with the young Indonesian, giving him his phone 
            number and calling him his adopted son. <br></br>
            <strong>He's incredibly talented</strong>
            Love him or loathe him, the one thing you can't deny is his skill.
            He is a phenomenal footballer who is up there with the all-time greats. 
            He scores goals, wins matches, and has trophy cabinet that is fit to burst including
            three champions league trophies, three premier league titles, la liga, 
            three World Player of the Year awards, and now he has an international trophy as Portugal won Euro 2016.
            Sports science lab experiments have recorded his free-kick at 80 mph,
            the fastest in the world. <br></br>Check out Cristiano's family time.
